Pagination refers to the process of dividing content, such as a long document or a list of items, into separate pages for easier navigation and readability. It typically involves breaking down the content into a series of discrete sections or pages with numbered buttons or links that allow users to navigate through the different parts of the content. Pagination is commonly used on websites, search results, articles, and other forms of online content to make it more organized and user-friendly.
